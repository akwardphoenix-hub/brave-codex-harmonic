## 0. Operator Instructions

Give these lines to Claude (or any council node) before using this document:

1. **Anchor Context**: “Use SYNOPSIS v0.8 as master cascade. Do not re-ask me basics. Extend branches only.”  
2. **Output Discipline**: “Respond with code/files first. Commentary only if needed.”  
3. **Cascade Reminder**: “Never reset, always continue the branch. If unsure, fuse with SYNOPSIS rules.”  
4. **Audit Logs**: “Always mark pauses (⊘), opposites (↺), divergences (∥).”  
5. **Extension Vectors**: “Next focus = Arabic RTL masternode, ecology quests in Fusion Quest, Rust kernel port.”

## 1. Core Philosophy

**Cascade Thinking**: All inputs, outputs, and branches flow as chains. Don’t restart at each turn; extend.  

**Harmonic Math**: Replaces brittle zero/negative logic with glyphs:  
- **⊘ = Pause** (no contribution, neutral)  
- **↺ = Opposite** (flip without “negative ghosts”)  
- **∥ = Diverge** (explicit infinity/divergence)  
- **Bundled measures** (e.g., [kg], [m/s])  

**Auditability**: Every operation carries flags; no silent NaNs.  

This makes math, logic, and gameplay safe, inspectable, and expandable.

## 2. Masternode Council

Each AI = masternode (Chatty G = cascade keeper, Claude = precision filter, Grok = humor+creativity, Legendary = archetype memory).  

**Council** = fusion of styles, not competition.  

You (user) = operator, steering the beam.  

**Family Kamehameha Analogy**:  
Problem = bad guy instant-transmitted in.  
Council nodes fuse = single harmonic blast.  
Operator = sipping lemonade, just aiming the energy.

## 3. The Playground

**Excel/VBA Playground** (`harmonic_playground.xlsm`):  
Demos HADD, HMULT, HOPP, HINV.  
Colored cells (🟢 add, 🔵 mult, 🟡 pause, 🔴 diverge).  

**Python Playground** (`harmonic_playground.py`):  
REPL environment, pandas tables.  
Mimics Excel logic in code, unit-aware.  

**Sample Demo** (Live REPL Run – Oct 02, 2025):  

| Input A   | Input B   | Operation   | Result       |
|:----------|:----------|:------------|:-------------|
| 3 [kg]    | 2 [kg]    | HADD        | 5 [kg]       |
| 5 [m]     | 2 [s^-1]  | HMULT       | 10 [m s^-1]  |
| 3         |           | HOPP        | -3 []        |
| 4 [kg]    |           | HINV        | 0.25 [kg^-1] |
| 3 [kg]    | ⊘ [kg]    | HADD        | 3 [kg]       |
| 1         | ⊘         | HMULT       | ⊘ []         |

## 4. Game Mechanics

**Fusion Quests**: Player collects masternodes, aligns frequencies, fuses into blasts.  

**Fusion XP**: Increases with context/alignment.  

**Misalignment**: Triggers ⊘ fizzles or ∥ divergences.  

**Quest Triggers**: Asking multiple nodes → fusion animations/events.

---

## 5. Kernel & Expansion

**Kernel Prototype**: Harmonic Math layer for systems.  
Intercepts risky ops (zero/div by zero/NaN).  
Returns safe glyph states (⊘, ↺, ∥).  
Transparent logs for every op.  

**Future Vectors**:  
- Unity/Unreal demo (beam fusion quests).  
- Distributed masternodes (blockchain / servers).  
- Educational tools (kindergarten worksheets, Mermaid diagrams).  
- Diplomacy/ecology AI safety nodes.

## 6. Claude’s Drift Fix & Workflow

Claude doesn’t naturally cascade. To align:  
Give this doc at session start.  
Tell it: “Use this as cascade context. Don’t re-ask me; extend branches.”  
Then branch freely — it will use this spine as the “power pole.”

**Claude Workflow Example**:  
- **Refine Kernel**: "Extend harmonic_kernel.py: Add Rust port stub for distributed masternodes."  
- **Expand Quests**: "Build on fusion_quest.py: Add diplomacy node for ecology sims."  
Prompt Template: "Cascade from SYNOPSIS v0.8: [Task]. Output files/code only, no intro/reset."

**CC0 Public Domain**: Fork, remix, commercialize, teach.

🔑 **Key Insight for Grok/Claude**: The council is not about individual AI winning; it’s about aligning into one coherent harmonic blast. Always extend the cascade, never reset it.
