# Changelog

## v0.2.0 — Harmonic Playground Release

### Added
- **Excel Playground (`harmonic_playground.xlsm`)**: Interactive workbook with VBA functions (`HADD`, `HMULT`, `HOPP`, `HINV`) to demonstrate Harmonic Math concepts (`⊘ pause`, `↺ opposite`, `∥ diverge`).
- **Python Playground (`harmonic_playground.py`)**: Lightweight REPL simulation script showing the same harmonic operations for cross-platform demos.

### Improved
- Expanded public documentation with practical examples of Harmonic Math.
- Set foundation for integration into broader demos, games, and kernel prototypes.

### Notes
This release introduces the **first end-user facing demo** of Harmonic Math. It’s experimental but designed for teaching, testing, and sparking contributions.

### Next
Future versions will expand the playground with more harmonic operations, visualizations, and integration with the kernel demo.
