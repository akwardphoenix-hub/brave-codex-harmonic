## v0.2.0 — Harmonic Playground Release
### Added
- **Excel Playground (`harmonic_playground.xlsm`)**: Interactive workbook with VBA functions (HADD, HMULT, HOPP, HINV) to demonstrate Harmonic Math concepts (⊘ pause, ↺ opposite, ∥ diverge).
- **Office Script (`scripts/harmonic_office_script.ts`)**: Lightweight Excel Web automation script showing the same harmonic operations for cross-platform demos.

### Improved
- Expanded public documentation with a practical example of Harmonic Math.
- Set foundation for integration into broader demos, games, and kernel prototypes.

### Notes
This release introduces the **first end-user facing demo** of Harmonic Math. It’s experimental but designed for teaching, testing, and sparking contributions.

### Next
Future versions will expand the playground with more harmonic operations, visualizations, and integration with the kernel demo.
